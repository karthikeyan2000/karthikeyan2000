# About Me

Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Karthikeyan.

I'm a pre-final year student at **SASTRA Deemed to be University** pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in **Computer Science and Engineering**. I'm interested in **Software Development**. I am the current Lead at DSC SASTRA Deemed to be University and a member of IEEE CS Society. I have worked on Android Development in both Java and Kotlin, Flutter Development, Web Development in Bootstrap and PHP(LAMP STACK), Cloud Solutions in both AWS and GCP, iOS Development in Swift and Game Development in Unity 3D. I'm also a part-time musician.

I have completed few courses and specialization from Coursera on GCP, iOS Development and Game Development. I started my Android Development from the free course offered by Google on Udacity. After completing those courses I applied and **joined DSC SASTRA** Deemed to be University as Core Team member of Android Cluster.

I love software development and I always wanted to make a difference in someone's life to make it better. As a core team member, I made a difference in the student's life by teaching them what I know and helping them experience software development and bringing softwares to life with their hands. I am also interested in OS Dev and I pursue it in my free time.

I **joined IEEE** in my first year for my goal towards helping community. I volunteer regularly in various events that helps community at large. On 11 Sep 2020, I got selected as **Lead of DSC SASTRA** Deemed To Be University for this term. Currently I am working towards helping our University students and trying to help the community as best as we can. I am also a **musician certified by Trinity College, London**. I perform once/twice a year along with others in South Music Association.
